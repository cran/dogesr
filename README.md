## Examples

This package includes a couple of vignettes. Once installed, write `vignette("dogesr")` to check what's available. Also

* `vignette("doges-family-types")` for how to use the family types data set
* `vignette("doges-terms")` to analyze the amount of time the doges lived/ruled using data provided in this package.
* `vignette("doges-social-network")` to get the marriage social network of doges and parents, and make some initial exploration.
* `vignette("counting-doge-families")` to work with a table of the families doges belonged to and how many times they actually "made doge"

## Work with data

Data in its original format is stored in the [`data-raw`](https://github.com/JJ/dogesr/tree/main/data-raw)
directory. If you change that data anyhow, type `make` to rebuild the
R data files (contained in the [`data`](data/) ) directory.

Any further change (columns and some such) will also need modification
of the documentation at the [`man`](man/) directory.
